# Determining Optimal Critical Values: Efficacy Comparison of New vs. Standard Aspirin Formulations

# Introduction
This project aims to identify the optimal critical value for the hypothesis testing to determine whether a new formulation of aspirin is more effective than the standard version. We want a critical value that allows both type 1 and type 2 errors to be below 5% for the test.

## File Descriptions
- `report.Rmd`: R script for the analysis.
- `report.pdf`: PDF export of the 'report.Rmd'.

## Installation
This project is developed using R and RStudio 2022.02.3. Refer to `report.Rmd` for the required packages.
